      During my undergraduate study at SJTU, **I won the Excellence Scholarship for three years continuously in 2018, 2019, and 2020.**

      Before joining Dartmouth, I had extensive industrial experience working as a software engineer. 

      1. Software Engineer Intern @ Amazon (05/2020 - 11/2020, Shanghai, China)
      2. Full-stack Engineer Intern @ SAP (11/2020 - 05/2021, Shanghai, China)
      3. Backend Software Engineer @ TP-Link (07/2021 - 07/2022, Shenzhen, China)

          - This work has been published on [IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, Impact Factor: 11.041](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=83)
          - We proposed a novel architecture, *DASGIL*, to implement the multi-scale representation for place recognition in robotic systems. 
            Explore more about our work through [Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.00573.pdf).

          - **Testing Results**:
            - Improved CPU utilization rate by 12.4% when processing UDP data during the Linux RPS packet receiving process by designing a novel data structure using the C language in the Linux kernel.
          - **My Contributions**:
            - Designed a two-level Hashmap structure to calculate the CPU ID for each group of UDP fragment data, enabling different groups of data to be processed by different CPUs.
            - Managed memory space usage by applying a “memory space reuse mechanism” based on linked lists using APIs in the Linux kernel for code implementation.
