# README

My personal website: https://mingcheng991129.github.io/

This repository contains the src of my personal website, referenced from [this link](https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile).



About the details:

1. The `config.yaml` contains all the contents shown on the website. 

   I changed this file and added the contents needed.

2. The folder `themes/hugo-profile/` contains the layout of the website. Specifically, 

   1. The `static/css` folder is to implement the layout of the webpage, e.g. the font size, the color, the card size, etc. 

      I changed the css style of each part of the website with my flavor, e.g. "About", "Work Experience", etc.

   2. The `images` folder contains the images I used for my website.

   3. The `layouts/partials` folder contains the `html` of different sections on the webpage.

       I created several `html` files on my own (e.g. `workexperiencewide.html`) to add contents that I need.

   4. The file `layouts/index.html` links all those pages together.

      I changed this file accordingly to link these pages successfully.
